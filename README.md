SharpMinecraft Launcher
====
_By Anthony Lomeli_

## Info

This is simply a template for those who want to make a custom Minecraft launcher in C#. Uses the .NET 3.5 Framework, so it should even work on Windows XP.

## Credits

This custom launcher uses code from this project: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1445929-clauncher-library/

It also uses the command line version of 7-zip to unzip the native files Minecraft uses. License here: http://www.7-zip.org/license.txt
